## Overview

This project is a fully functional, dual-mode implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, expanded to include the "Lizard Spock" variation. Beyond the standard gameplay, it features a seamless mode-switching system, persistent score tracking, and a highly responsive, pixel-perfect UI.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- **Bonus**: Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer
- **Bonus**: Toggle between the two game modes seamlessly

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For static typing
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - For styling variables
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - For layout
- [Mobile-first workflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design#mobile-first_design) - For responsive design

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of state management in React, particularly when dealing with complex game logic and mode-switching. Implementing the pentagon layout for the "Bonus" mode was a great exercise in absolute positioning and responsive scaling.

### Features

- **Dual Game Modes**: Switch between the standard 3-choice game and the 5-choice "Lizard Spock" variation.
- **Score Persistence**: Your progress is automatically saved to browser storage.
- **Responsive Layout**: Pixel-perfect designs for both mobile and desktop views.
- **Interactive Modals**: Dynamic rules modal that adapts to the current game mode.
